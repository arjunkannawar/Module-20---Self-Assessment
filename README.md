# Module-20---Self-Assessment

## Project Summary

**Selected Topic**: Global Diet, Population and Covid-19 Mortality 

**Topic selection insight:** In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, we chose to explore relating to the potential influences that a country's resources, population and quality of life has on the likelihood of Covid-19 mortality.

**Questions we hope to answer with the data:**
- Are we able to predict the level of deaths from Covid-19 based on a country's food supply and obesity level?
- Does a country's population facts effect the likelihood of death as an outcome of Covid-19?
- Can a country's HDI Rating, GDP & Life Expectancy be predictors of it's Covid-19 Death Outcomes? 

**Description of Data Exploration Phase of the Project:**

The exploration phase of our project was comprised of three main steps:

  1. Exploring the relationship between a country's Food Supply, Obesity level and their Covid Deaths per Million. 
  2. Exploring the relationship between a country's Population features and their Covid Deaths per Million.
  3. Exploring the relationship between HDI Rating, GDP Per capita, Life Expectancy and the each country's Covid Deaths per Million.

**Description of The Anlaysis Phase of the Project:**

Upon completion of the data exploration, we analyzed our data against the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)* that we have identified as areas of interest in our analysis.

**Technologies Used**

_Software_: Google Colab, Python, HTML, SQLite, Tableau, AWS, Postgres DB<br>
_Libraries_: Pandas, Scikit-learn, SQLAlchemy, Path

**Description of The Anlaysis Phase of the Project:**

Upon completion of the data exploration, we will analyze our data against the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)* that we have identified as areas of interest in our analysis. To visualize the results of our analysis, we will use Tableau to display the relationships that exist within our dataset, and to showcase the KPIs of interest.
