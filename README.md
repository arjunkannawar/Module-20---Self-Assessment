# Module-20---Self-Assessment

## Project Summary

**Selected Topic**: Global Diet, Population and Covid-19 Mortality 

**Topic selection insight:** In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, we chose to explore relating to the potential influences that a country's resources, population and quality of life has on the likelihood of Covid-19 mortality.

**Questions we hope to answer with the data:**
- Are we able to predict the level of deaths from Covid-19 based on a country's food supply and obesity level?
- Does a country's population facts effect the likelihood of death as an outcome of Covid-19?
- Can a country's HDI Rating, GDP & Life Expectancy be predictors of it's Covid-19 Death Outcomes? 

**Description of Data Exploration Phase of the Project:**

The exploration phase of our project was comprised of three main steps:

  1. Exploring the relationship between a country's Food Supply, Obesity level and their Covid Deaths per Million. 
  2. Exploring the relationship between a country's Population features and their Covid Deaths per Million.
  3. Exploring the relationship between HDI Rating, GDP Per capita, Life Expectancy and the each country's Covid Deaths per Million.

**Description of The Anlaysis Phase of the Project:**

Upon completion of the data exploration, we analyzed our data against the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)* that we have identified as areas of interest in our analysis.

**Technologies Used**

_Software_: Google Colab, Python, HTML, SQLite, Tableau, AWS, Postgres DB<br>
_Libraries_: Pandas, Scikit-learn, SQLAlchemy, Path

**Project outlook**

  1. The strongest predictor of  Covid-19 morbidity in our analysis of  age, population, food supply and quality of life as predictors, is age.
  2. Death rate & deaths per million are most strongly correlated to a countries population over 65 & over 70. 
  3. Population over 70 was also the highest feature of importance in the machine learning model.
