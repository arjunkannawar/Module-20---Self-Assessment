# Module-20---Self-Assessment

## Project Summary

**Selected Topic**: Global Diet, Population and Covid-19 Mortality 

**Topic selection insight:** In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, we chose to explore relating to the potential influences that a country's resources, population and quality of life has on the likelihood of Covid-19 mortality.

**Desciption of the source of data**: Our [dataset](https://github.com/Mikeblanchard/Covid_Project/blob/mike/CSVs/Merged.csv) contains the calculated fat quantity, energy intake (kcal), food supply quantity (kg), and protein for different categories of food (all calculated as percentage of total intake amount). In addition to this, it includes the obesity and undernourished rate (also in percentage) for comparison. The end of the datasets also included the most up to date confirmed/deaths/recovered/active cases (also in percentage of current population for each country. Additional columns have been merged with the dataset to include population data, Human Development Index Rating (HDI) and GDP Per capita.

**Questions we hope to answer with the data:**
- Are we able to predict the level of deaths from Covid-19 based on a country's food supply and obesity level?
- Does a country's population facts effect the likelihood of death as an outcome of Covid-19?
- Can a country's HDI Rating, GDP & Life Expectancy be predictors of it's Covid-19 Death Outcomes? 

**Description of Data Exploration Phase of the Project:**

The exploration phase of our project will be comprised of three main steps:

  1. Exploring the relationship between a country's Food Supply, Obesity level and their Covid Deaths per Million. 
  2. Exploring the relationship between a country's Population features and their Covid Deaths per Million.
  3. Exploring the relationship between HDI Rating, GDP Per capita, Life Expectancy and the each country's Covid Deaths per Million.

**Description of The Anlaysis Phase of the Project:**

Upon completion of the data exploration, we will analyze our data against the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)* that we have identified as areas of interest in our analysis. To visualize the results of our analysis, we will use Tableau to display the relationships that exist within our dataset, and to showcase the KPIs of interest.
